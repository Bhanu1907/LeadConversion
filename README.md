# LeadConversion
Analytics consulting simulation working for mid-size private bank to develop a lead prediction system. Following is a quick brief.

A mid-sized private bank, "World Plus," has approached an analytics consultancy to pitch for a contract to develop a lead prediction system. The bank offers various financial products and uses multiple channels to reach customers but faces challenges in identifying high-potential leads for their new term deposit product. The goal is to improve lead targeting, reduce marketing costs, and increase conversion rates.

World Plus has provided a dataset of 220,000 historical customer records for analysis. Several firms are competing for the contract, with the decision based on each firm’s demonstrated solution. The consultancy will present a 10-minute video pitch to the bank’s management, highlighting the system’s business benefits, alongside a 2,000-word technical report explaining the methodology.
